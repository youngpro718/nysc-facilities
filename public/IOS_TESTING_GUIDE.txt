üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING:
==================

ISSUE: App opens in Safari instead of standalone
FIX: Make sure you installed from Home Screen, not just bookmarked

ISSUE: No install prompt appears
FIX: Check manifest.json is accessible at /manifest.json
     Verify HTTPS is enabled
     Clear Safari cache and try again

ISSUE: Icons not showing
FIX: Run: node generate-icons.cjs
     Replace public/icon-source.png with your logo
     Run again to regenerate

ISSUE: Push notifications not working
FIX: Must be installed to Home Screen (not in Safari)
     Check iOS Settings ‚Üí Notifications ‚Üí NYSC Hub
     Verify VAPID keys are configured

ISSUE: Offline mode not working
FIX: Check service worker is registered
     Open in production (not localhost)
     Check browser console for SW errors

ISSUE: App not updating

     Force reload: Settings ‚Üí Safari ‚Üí Clear History
     Or wait for auto-update (checks hourly)
