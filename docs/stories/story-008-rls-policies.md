## üîê RLS Policy Framework

### Policy Naming Convention
```
Format: <table>_<operation>_<condition>

Examples:
rooms_select_public
rooms_insert_facilities_staff
rooms_update_owner_or_admin
rooms_delete_admin_only
```

### Policy Template
```sql
-- Policy: [POLICY_NAME]
-- Description: [WHAT THIS POLICY DOES]
-- Applies to: [ROLES/CONDITIONS]

CREATE POLICY "[policy_name]" ON [table_name]
  FOR [SELECT|INSERT|UPDATE|DELETE|ALL]
  [USING (condition)]  -- For SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE
  [WITH CHECK (condition)];  -- For INSERT, UPDATE
```

---

## üß™ RLS Testing Framework

### Test Helper Functions
```sql
-- Function to test RLS as different users
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION test_rls_as_user(
  p_user_id UUID,
  p_table_name TEXT,
  p_operation TEXT
)
RETURNS TABLE (
  can_access BOOLEAN,
  row_count BIGINT,
  error_message TEXT
) AS $$
DECLARE
  v_query TEXT;
  v_count BIGINT;
BEGIN
  -- Set session to test user
  PERFORM set_config('request.jwt.claim.sub', p_user_id::TEXT, true);
  
  -- Build test query
  v_query := format('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM %I', p_table_name);
  
  BEGIN
    EXECUTE v_query INTO v_count;
    RETURN QUERY SELECT true, v_count, NULL::TEXT;
  EXCEPTION WHEN OTHERS THEN
    RETURN QUERY SELECT false, 0::BIGINT, SQLERRM;
  END;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
```

### RLS Test Cases
```sql
-- Test Suite: RLS Policies
DO $$
DECLARE
  admin_user_id UUID := '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001';
  regular_user_id UUID := '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002';
  test_result RECORD;
BEGIN
  RAISE NOTICE 'Starting RLS Test Suite...';
  
  -- Test 1: Admin can view all rooms
  SELECT * INTO test_result 
  FROM test_rls_as_user(admin_user_id, 'rooms', 'SELECT');
  
  IF test_result.can_access THEN
    RAISE NOTICE 'PASS: Admin can view rooms (% rows)', test_result.row_count;
  ELSE
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'FAIL: Admin cannot view rooms: %', test_result.error_message;
  END IF;
  
  -- Test 2: Regular user can view active rooms
  SELECT * INTO test_result 
  FROM test_rls_as_user(regular_user_id, 'rooms', 'SELECT');
  
  IF test_result.can_access THEN
    RAISE NOTICE 'PASS: Regular user can view rooms (% rows)', test_result.row_count;
  ELSE
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'FAIL: Regular user cannot view rooms: %', test_result.error_message;
  END IF;
  
  -- Test 3: Regular user cannot view audit logs
  SELECT * INTO test_result 
  FROM test_rls_as_user(regular_user_id, 'audit_logs', 'SELECT');
  
  IF NOT test_result.can_access OR test_result.row_count = 0 THEN
    RAISE NOTICE 'PASS: Regular user cannot view audit logs';
  ELSE
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'FAIL: Regular user can view audit logs (% rows)', test_result.row_count;
  END IF;
  
  RAISE NOTICE 'RLS Test Suite Complete!';
END $$;
```

## üìä RLS Performance Impact

### Performance Monitoring
```sql
-- Monitor RLS policy execution time
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW rls_performance AS
SELECT 
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  policyname,
  pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) as table_size,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = t.tablename) as policy_count
FROM pg_tables t
WHERE rowsecurity = true
ORDER BY pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename) DESC;

-- Query to check slow queries with RLS
SELECT 
  query,
  calls,
  total_time,
  mean_time,
  max_time
FROM pg_stat_statements
WHERE query LIKE '%WHERE%auth.uid%'
ORDER BY mean_time DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Optimization Strategies
1. **Index on user_id columns** for fast policy checks
2. **Materialized views** for complex policy conditions
3. **Function-based policies** for reusable logic
4. **Bypass RLS** for service accounts (with caution)

## üîí Security Audit Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] All sensitive tables have RLS enabled
- [ ] Each table has policies for all operations (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- [ ] No tables allow anonymous access unless intended
- [ ] Admin override policies are properly restricted
- [ ] Audit logs are read-only for non-admins
- [ ] User roles table is properly protected

### Testing
- [ ] Test as admin user
- [ ] Test as regular user
- [ ] Test as anonymous user
- [ ] Test cross-user data access (should fail)
- [ ] Test policy bypass attempts
- [ ] Performance test with RLS enabled

### Documentation
- [ ] All policies documented
- [ ] Access matrix created
- [ ] Security exceptions documented
- [ ] Incident response plan updated

---
