- [x] Data model types defined in feature modules
- [x] Service layer established for data access
- [x] RLS policies documented and in place
- [x] Audit trail system designed

#### 📝 Notes

### EPIC-002: UI Architecture

**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Completed:** October 25, 2025

#### ✅ Completed Deliverables
- [x] **Feature-based architecture** - Vertical slices implemented
  - `src/features/facilities/` with model, services, hooks, components
  - Clean separation of concerns
  - Single entry point per feature (`index.ts`)

- [x] **Service-layer enforcement** - Architectural guardrails active
  - ESLint rule banning `@supabase/supabase-js` imports outside services
  - Custom rule with clear error messages
  - Overrides for service directories

- [x] **TypeScript path aliases** - Clean imports established
  - `@features/*` → `src/features/*`
  - `@services/*` → `src/services/*`
  - `@ui/*` → `src/ui/*`
  - `@shared/*` → `src/shared/*`
  - Configured in `tsconfig.json`, `tsconfig.app.json`, and `vite.config.ts`

- [x] **Zod validation** - Runtime type safety at boundaries
  - Schemas defined in `src/features/facilities/schemas.ts`
  - Validation helpers for all data shapes
  - Service layer integration started

- [x] **Standardized data-state UI** - Consistent UX patterns
  - `src/ui/DataState.tsx` component created
  - Handles Loading, Empty, Error, Ready states
  - Adopted in `Keys.tsx`, `MyIssues.tsx`, `Facilities.tsx`

- [x] **Thin pages pattern** - Pages use feature hooks/components
  - `src/pages/FacilitiesExample.tsx` demonstrates pattern
  - Pages delegate to feature layer
  - Minimal business logic in pages

- [x] **React Query integration** - Server state management
  - Query hooks in `src/features/facilities/hooks/useFacilities.ts`
  - Mutation hooks in `src/features/facilities/hooks/useFacilitiesMutations.ts`
  - Proper caching and invalidation

#### 📝 Notes
- Architecture is clean and maintainable
- Guardrails prevent architectural drift
- Ready for team to adopt patterns across all features
