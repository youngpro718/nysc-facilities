## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### **Clean Architecture Principles**

**Service Layer Pattern:**
```
Components → Hooks → Services → Supabase
     ↓         ↓         ↓
   No DB    React    Single
   Calls    Query    Source
```

**Benefits Achieved:**
- ✅ Single source of truth for data operations
- ✅ Easy to test and mock
- ✅ Consistent error handling
- ✅ Automatic caching and refetching
- ✅ Optimistic updates

### **Data-State UI Pattern**

All pages implement 4 states:
1. **Loading** - Skeleton loaders
2. **Error** - Error message with retry
3. **Empty** - Helpful empty state
4. **Ready** - Data display

### **URL-Based State Management**

Filters and tabs in URL for:
- Shareable links
- Bookmarkable pages
- Browser back/forward support
