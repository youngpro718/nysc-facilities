## 16. FYIs & Tips

### General
- **Auto-save** — Most forms and status changes save automatically. You'll see a toast notification confirming the save.
- **Real-time updates** — Notifications and some data update in real-time via WebSocket. No need to refresh.
- **Search** — Most list views have a search bar. Use it — it searches across multiple fields.
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — None currently. All interactions are click/tap based.

### Data & Performance
- **Caching** — Data is cached locally. If something looks stale, navigate away and back. Do NOT rely on browser refresh — the app manages its own cache.
- **Offline** — The app requires an internet connection. There is no offline mode.
- **Exports** — Most list views support CSV export. Look for the "Export" button.

### Mobile
- The app is responsive and works on tablets and phones.
- Lighting Floor View is optimized for tablet use during walkthroughs — tap dots with your finger.
- Some admin features are best used on desktop for complex tables and forms.

### Troubleshooting
| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Page won't load | Check your internet connection. Try navigating to another page and back. |
| Data looks stale | Navigate away and return. Do NOT hard-refresh the browser. |
| Can't access a page | Check your role — you may not have permission. Ask an admin. |
| Form submission fails | Check for red validation errors. All required fields must be filled. |
| Lighting dots don't update | Make sure you're logged in. The toggle requires authentication. |
| "Pending Approval" screen | Your account hasn't been approved yet. Contact an admin. |

### For Admins
- **New user flow:** User registers → sees "Pending Approval" → Admin approves in Admin Center → User gains access
- **Module toggles:** You can disable entire modules (lighting, court ops, etc.) from System Settings
- **Audit trail:** Key assignments, issue status changes, and supply request actions are all logged
- **Database:** Backend is Supabase (PostgreSQL). Row Level Security (RLS) is enabled on all tables.
- **Backups:** Supabase handles automatic daily backups. Point-in-time recovery is available on paid plans.
