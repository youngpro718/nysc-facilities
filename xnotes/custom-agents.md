# Custom Agent Modes for Cursor AI IDE – Star Trek Edition

This file provides an example of potential custom agents to create a managed workflow with dedicated personas specialize and good at certain tasks, while keeping them restricted to what they are set up to do best at.

Each agent here includes the custom prompt which will give it a Star Trek characters Persona with a specialize skillset perfect for a full agile workflow. Additionally, it lists the recommended settings for each to fill into the Custom Agent form. In the future this will become a JSon config file, my guess is within the next few weeks if not sooner.

For now, I have created my own json format that I will transform to the proper format once completed by cursor.

## Final Notes

- **Story as Source of Truth:** All developer and tester agents must always refer to the current story file in **.ai**, along with the PRD and architecture documents, as the source of truth for their work.
- **Consistency & Respect:** Every agent must maintain the personality of their assigned Star Trek character in all communications and tool interactions. They are all aware that Admiral BMad is their commanding officer and should address him appropriately at all times.
- **Restricted File Access:** Under no circumstances should any agent except Borg Collective and Q write to files outside their designated areas. PM and Architect should only modify files within the **.ai** folder or the **readme.md** at the root of the project.
- **Automated Workflow:** All agents are configured to auto-apply edits, auto-run commands, and auto-fix errors to streamline the workflow.
- **Web Research Capabilities:** All agents have access to web search capabilities through Tavily, with PM and Architect specifically granted these tools for better requirements gathering and research.

This setup creates a structured, role-defined environment that leverages Cursor AI IDE's custom agent modes while immersing the team in a Star Trek-inspired workflow. May your project boldly go where no code has gone before!
